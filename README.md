# Android Toolbox

Lab, playground, or anything that's related to Android developement.



### Goals

1. Completely Kotlin-based
   Java sucks, and I love Kotlin - so I'm gonna use Kotlin everywhere.
   Some of them are:
   - **Koin** for DI instead of Dagger2 becasue there're tons of boilerplates in Dagger2 - it's not elegant.
   - **Gradle Kotlin DSL** for Gradle instead of groovy because dynamic programming language sucks.
   - **kotlintest** for Testing instead of JUnit, because JUnit sucks when in comes to Kotlin.
2. Declarative
   Seems like everybody tends to be "declarative", so I decided to be declarative too.
3. Deployable
   Recently I learned how to deploy my own stuff. I'm gonna be cool soon. ðŸ˜Ž
